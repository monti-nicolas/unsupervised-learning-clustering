# unsupervised-learning-clustering
Using principal component and clustering analysis on a customer segmentation case.

I submitted this project as part of the Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program. The goal was to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data used has been provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, it represents a real-life data science task and I am not allowed to share it.

Through this notebook you will find information on:
- data exploration
- data pre-processing
- re-encoding features
- feature transformation
- principal components
- clustering
